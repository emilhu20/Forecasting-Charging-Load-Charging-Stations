# Forecasting the Charging Load on Public Electric Charging Stations
A spatio temporal hybrid model for predicting the charging demand at charging stations. The model is developed with the intent to evaluate the charging demand at charging stations placed at new locations i.e. without historical time series data. The model is a hybrid between a Graph Neural Network (GNN) and a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU).
